There are three state files that bc-server keeps updated in order to provide
information to the web side, which in turn provides information to the web
interface and the client. All three reside in /var/state/bluecherry/ and
always exist. If any of the files do no exist, then one can assume that
bc-server has a broken install state.

== running ==

This file reflects that bc-server is running. The atime will be updated every
60 seconds, which coincides with the interval at which bc-server checks the
database for new updates.


== media-writable ==

This file reflects that bc-server is able to write to the media system. It's
atime will be the epoch (00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970) normally. Upon failure to
write to the media system, the atime will be updated to the time of the
failure.


== db-writable ==

This file works the same as media-writable except that it refelcts the state
of the database. It will normally have an atime of the epoch, and will be
updated to the time of the database failure.
