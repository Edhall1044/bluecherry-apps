Whenever the SQL schema is changed, add a file in mysql-upgrade with a
name of the package version where the upgrade should be applied and the
.sql extension, e.g. "1:2.0.0-0beta8.sql". Migration SQL should always
produce a result IDENTICAL to a newly-installed database from mysql/,
and MUST preserve all data if the upgrade will run without manual
intervention.

Be sure it's noted that downgrades will not be possible if your change is
not backwards compatible.
